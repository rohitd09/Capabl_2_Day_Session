## ðŸ¤– LangChain Agent Updates

**File:** `D2S3agents_in_langchain.ipynb`

### Changes
1. **Added Stopping Condition in Predefined Prompt**
   - Implemented a termination rule to prevent infinite or recursive prompt loops in agent execution.
   - Improves reliability during conversational tasks and chained reasoning workflows.

2. **Enabled Parsing Error Handling**
   - Added parameter:
     ```
     handle_parsing_errors=True
     ```
   - **Impact:** Prevents crashes from malformed or unexpected model outputs, ensuring smoother error recovery and response generation.
